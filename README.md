# RadioTherm

Now that Radio Thermostat has killed their support for their own app (who could
have ever seen that coming /s) here's a dumb app to do basic control of the 
thermostat on your own.

Contained is a WPF app (that probably only works on Windows) and a Blazor web app
with accompanying Dockerfile to make an image. I have this running on a Raspberry
Pi 3B

All this is as-is. Treat it like the garbage code it is. Built with VS 2022.
